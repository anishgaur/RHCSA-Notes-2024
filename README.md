# RHCSA 9 Notes
-------
The Red Hat Certified System Administrator exam is a performance-based exam that tests your knowledge and skill in areas of system administration common across a wide range of environments and deployment scenarios.  

As per the official Red Hat exam description, a Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) is able to perform the following tasks:
- Understand and use essential tools for handling files, directories, command-line environments, and documentation
- Create simple shell scripts
- Operate running systems, including booting into different run levels, identifying processes, starting and stopping virtual machines, and controlling services
- Configure local storage using partitions and logical volumes
- Create and configure file systems and file system attributes, such as permissions, encryption, access control lists, and network file systems
- Deploy, configure, and maintain systems, including software installation, update, and core services
- Manage users and groups
- Manage security, including basic firewall and SELinux configuration
- Perform basic container management

There are many resources for studying for the examination online, however my personal recommendation would go to Sander Van Vugt's Video course and the accompanying text book. 

I will update this repo with relevant resources shortly.
I hope these will prove to be valueable to you in your prep for the RHCSA.
